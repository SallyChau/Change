# COMP1720 Art and Interaction in New Media
_Australian National University, 2nd term 2014_

_Course Convener: Dr. Henry Gardner (https://cs.anu.edu.au/people/Henry.Gardner/)_

A project submission by Sally Chau

I created this project in the context of the course Art and Computer Interaction during my exchange year 2014 at the ANU. The objective of the project was to implement an interactive visual piece of art reflecting the topic of "Change". This application was written in processing (https://processing.org/).

The document "Project Specification.pdf" describes the project in detail. In the document "Interaction Statement.pdf", I described how and why I chose to implement the topic "Change" in the way it is on hand. Also, I explain which interactive steps I planned to allure and include the user in this piece of art.
